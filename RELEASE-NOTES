* MIME Internals

    Correct encoding and decoding for the filename parameter in the Content-Disposition.
    Should store the disposition-type without Content-Disposition parameters.


* Attachment Provider 
    AttachmentProvider can now return an attachment with an unmodified MIME type. However, when viewing attachments this is not desirable. So we try hard to return a sensible MIME type (use extension to look up a MIME type if it's originally "application/octet-stream"; or replace with canonical MIME type if it's known to be wrong, e.g.  "image/jpg" -> "image/jpeg")

* Composing Messages

    Initial support for a button to look up contacts in a contact provider
    Issue 3104: Can't bcc to more than 1 address
    Explicitly set focus to "To:" input field when composing or forwarding a message.

* Account List

    Grey out unavailable accounts.


* Build system

    Restore tools/build-beta to its former glory. It can now build a "K9 beta with different keys" that can sit next to an installed K-9.

* Message Display

    Fixed issue 873 where JPEG images with the MIME type "image/jpg" failed to open on some Motorola phones.

* Message List

    Fixed issue 2991: Should display colorized name in the message list.
    The date format preference is now refreshed each time the messages get listed.  Previously, changes to the date format preference weren't noticed until the app restarted.
    Performance fix: Use ListView#addFooterView to add the footer to MEssage Lists
    Mark messages as ANSWERED only on send.  Save a reference to the message in the identity so that loading a draft of a reply also marks the referenced message correctly.

* Folder List

    "Allow filtering in FolderList" update issue 3130

    Fixes Issue 3102 in cooperation with vincent...@gmail.com
    
    Reset service enablement and MailService scheduling whenever a storage medium is mounted or unmounted.

* WebDAV
    In getPersonalNameSpaces now we ask the server for the real folder names corresponding to the special folders ids (for which we have constants), so we can map the account folders using the real names.
    Support non-English Exchange installations.
    Fix the ability to accept invalid SSL certificates for exchange support.

* Stability
    Fixed several  NullPointerExceptions

* SSL 
    Added SHA-1 checksum to acceptKeyDialog
* POP3
    Made the minor modifications to support CRAM-MD5 authentication in POP3 accounts.
    Disable "Enable refile buttons" preference for POP3 users

* SMTP

    Switch K-9 to using the SMTP submission port rather than the regular server-to-server transport port.
    Permanent failures when trying to deliver a message move it back to drafts.
    Tempfail outgoing messages after 5 delivery attempts
    Opening a "permfail" message takes you to the drafts folder
    Split out "tempfail" and "permfail" message delivery errors
    Fix "sending message failed" notifications to actually report the server error
    If an SMTP server tells us how big the biggest message they accept is, don't even try to deliver a message to them if it's bigger than that size
    For a while, it was possible for users to configure their outbox and drafts folders to be the same folder. This could result in drafts being sent over and over.  This change uses the K-9 Identity header as a shibboleth for drafts, as it's not actually set when a message is sent.
    Removed some extra spaces from SMTP commands which picky servers rejected Fixed gcode #3182


* Configurability

    Implemented option to hide special accounts (issue 3060)
    BUGFIX: time changes are still honored even if the user choose the [abort] button of the DialogPreference.
    Added option to disable confirmation dialog for "mark all as read" Fixes issue 1415
    Added "move to spam folder" confirmation dialog to MessageList

* Internationalization
    German updates (By badgering rafl on IRC)
    Updated Japanese translation. catch up with 4aec4b0.
    Updated polish translation (rabbbit)

    Updated polish translation (alekhavoc)

    Finnish updates from Patrik Selin
    Added Catalan translation from David Valls
    Allow emoji input in subjects (On Japanese Devices only)
    Could not handle iso-2022-jp streams which contain continuous escape sequences.
    Fix range check for ISO-2022-JP stream.

* IMAP

    Remove trailing space from IMAP command This could be the cause of the error reported in issue 3089.
    Fix length-check of BODYSTRUCTURE reply. Fixes issue 3116
    Unify two IMAP date parsing paths, improving the exception so we can learn what date format we don't cope with.
    Added another badDateTimeFormat to ImapResponseParser.  Some IMAP servers generate timestamps without timezones. :/ Fixes gcode issue 3179
    Fix bug with partitioning of IMAP FETCH commands

* HTML Mail

    Use <pre> instead of <div> so that plain text clients get the line wrapping correct.

    Updates to the view need to happen on the UI thread
    
      Fixes downloading attachments (would just fail silently)
    
      Also added a ProgressDialog since progress() just asks for progress to displayed in the title bar. Since there is no title bar, no progress is shown at all.

    At Jesse's suggestion, avoid the use of the Android term-of-art "density". Instead use "Compact layouts" to refer, both internally and externally, to the feature of elminating minimum sizes on UI elements and other minor layout changes for maximizing information quantity to be displayed on a page.
    
    Others are free to adjust the user-facing text further.

    Fix for NPE introduced in r3258.

commit ea3619b733bdcd1d85e35de81833a77f8d1acba3
Author: Dan Applebaum <danapple@danapple.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 4 08:26:16 2011 +0000

    Display a message in the titlebar when K-9 Mail is not performing any message synchronization. This state will happen when no network is available, when background ops/background data/auto-sync settings turn off synchronization, or when no account is set for polling or pushing.
    
    This revision respects the intention of r3011 that when K-9 Mail is
    set for pushing only no message is displayed, as that condition is a
    normal state.  However, it provides valuable feedback in other cases
    that synchronization is off-line, as was done in r1433.
    
    Although the case when the user has intentionally set no account for
    polling or pushing can be considered "normal" and therefore unworthy
    of a message, it turns out to be a significant burden to detect that
    situation when the network is offline, since we normally do not even
    try to figure out the account configurations in that case.  Therefore,
    without making substantial, otherwise unwarranted, changes to
    MailService.java, "Syncing off" would be displayed sometimes to such a
    user, and sometimes not.  Since it is presumably a rare case, and
    there is minimal harm to display the "Syncing off" message, the
    message will be consistently displayed when no account is set for
    polling or pushing.

    Provide for users with good eyesight to completely take advantage of the
    "smaller" (and smaller) fonts by allowing the Accounts and Folder List
    items to have a height smaller than the normal Android minimum.  This
    option is off by default to maintain existing behavior for
    uninterested parties.  The preferences text is not especially
    compelling so could certainly be changed if better phrasing is found.

* Build Infrastructure
 
    Checking in new k9mail.iml (which matches the module name) with the latest dependencies.
    compile in the libs we only need at build time when building with eclipse.  This is an annoying default, but it'll make life easier for newbies starting out with K-9 for eclipse.  We should ALWAYS do release builds with ant
    Big, scary massive "ant astyle" to get us back to something approximating AOSP coding standards.
    Add the astyle target
    switch build infrastructure to git

* About box

    Fix display of icon in About box on Android 2.1 and earlier

* Performance

    Destroy all messages in one sqlite transaction
    Perf improvement: use parcels instead of serializable. Standard Java serialization is slow on Android. Replacing it w/ parcelable makes it around 10x faster (on a N1, with ~ 500 messages in the list).


* Third-party libraries

    Replaced our local copy of jzlib with a clean jar built from jzlib 1.0.7 downloaded from jcraft: http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/jzlib-1.0.7.tar.gz
    Replaced local version of jutf7 with a homebuilt jar from:
    Replaced Apache Commons IO with v2.01 downloaded from apache.org as a prebuilt JAR
    Tell eclipse to bundle JARs in libs but NOT to bundle libs in compile-only-libs. (Results in Eclipse building something much closer to what ant does)
    Start building using a JAR of MIME4J
    Add support for building with precompiled JARs
    Removed dependency on (external) commons-codec and commons-logging
    Get rid of now unnecessary BouncyCastle jar
    Use SslCertificate that is part of the official Android API instead of BouncyCastle's X509Name (which is not shipped anymore in Android 3.0) to verify domain names on SSL/TLS connections.
    Use java.util.zip for inflating Can't use it for deflating since it doesn't have Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH

* Portability

    Change our technique for sending \r\n at the end of smtp commands to deal with a weird failure on honeycomb

* Testing

    We have a test suite that can run (thanks to achen's start)

* Sharing Messages

    Add extra for the sender address(es) to the "Share intent"
    Get rid of the "Fwd: " prefix when sharing a message. Add recipients to the intent ("To:" -> EXTRA_EMAIL, "CC:" -> EXTRA_CC)
